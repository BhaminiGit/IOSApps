# StabilEyes app

This is an app that I am creating for The University of Pittsburgh's VIA lab.

Via Lab is directed by Dr. George Stetten

This app will achieve clearer vision for patients with Nystagmus (visual impairment characterized by involuntary, periodic eye motion)

Uses SwiftUI, ARKit, and image processing to analyze eye movements using the iPhone front and back camera

The app will analyze the periodic eye motion of the patient using the front camera and will display in real time, a clear image of the object focused by the back camera

** *WORK IN PROGRESS* **
